   from vq_vla import VQLA
   model = VQLA.load('path_to_pretrained_model')
   ```

2. Prepare your data:
   - Ensure your input data is in the correct format (images and corresponding text).
   - Tokenize your actions using the provided tokenizer.

3. Run the model:
   ```python
   results = model.predict(input_data)
   ```

4. Analyze the output to improve your applications.

## Model Training

Training the VQ-VLA model involves the following steps:

1. Prepare your dataset with labeled images and action descriptions.
2. Use the provided training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_dir /path/to/data --epochs 50
   ```

3. Monitor the training process and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
4. Save your trained model for future use.
